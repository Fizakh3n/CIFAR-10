# CIFAR-10
# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a baseline accuracy of around 75%. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout, and batch normalization.

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

This project aims to build a CNN model that can effectively classify these images.

## Dataset

- The dataset is available directly through Keras.
- It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
