# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of **60,000 32x32 color images** across **10 classes**:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The dataset is split into **50,000 training images** and **10,000 test images**.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:
--pip install tensorflow matplotlib visualkeras

## Dataset
- The dataset is available directly through Keras.
- It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
